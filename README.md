#Roomtrol Daemon
This repository holds the code for the Roomtrol daemon that runs on controllers and interacts with devices. More information can be found in the wiki (like [how to write devices](https://github.com/mwylde/roomtrol-daemon/wiki/Device), [how to set up Ubuntu](https://github.com/mwylde/roomtrol-daemon/wiki/Installing-and-customizing-Ubuntu), and various planning docs) and in the documentation, which can be generated by running `rake docs` inside the roomtrol-daemon directory.

Roomtrol is split into three parts: this daemon, [roomtrol-server](https://github.com/mwylde/roomtrol-server) which holds both the backend and frontend code run on the central server as well as the touchscreen interface, and [roomtrol-devices](https://github.com/mwylde/roomtrol-devices) which holds the various device drivers that have been written.
