module RoomtrolVideo
	# This class is reponsible for recording video and playing back the current state of
	# the camera. It is controlled over AMQP. There are several kinds of messages you can
	# send over the wire, all of which should be encoded via JSON. In each of these messages,
	# id is a unique id which the client can use to recognize a response (as each response
	# will also include this id) and queue is the queue to which the client wants the response
	# sent.
	# 
	# ###start_time_get
	# To get the time that recording started at, send a message like this:
	#
	# 	!!!json
	# 	{
	# 		id: "FF00F317-108C-41BD-90CB-388F4419B9A1",
	# 		queue: "roomtrol:video_recorder:35",
	# 		get: "start_time"
	# 	}
	# You will get a response like this:
	# 	!!!json
	# 	{
	# 		id: "FF00F317-108C-41BD-90CB-388F4419B9A1",
	# 		result: "2010-10-19 17:45:29 -0400"
	# 	}
	#
	# ###current_state_get
	# To get the current state (one of RemoteRecorder::PlayingState, 
	# RemoteRecorder::RECORDING_STATE or RemoteRecorder::STOPPED_STATE):
	# 
	# 	!!!json
