module Wescontrol
  # Wescontrol websocket server. Used to provide better interactivity to
  # the touchscreen interface. Communication is through JSON, like for
  # Wescontrol HTTP. Due to the nature of web sockets, message can either
  # be sent from the server to the client or the other direction. In general,
  # messages sent to the client are to notify of state changes, like a projector
  # turning on or a source being changed, while those from the client are
  # requests to change to state of a device or send a command. Note that every
  # message has an "id" field, which is merely a unique identifier for that
  # message. All responses to a request (whichever direction it travels) should
  # include the id of the request. Any string can be used as an id, but GUIDs
  # are recommended.
  #
  # #Messages
  # ##Client -> Server
  # ###State get requests
  # Gets information about the current state of elements in the system. Requests
  # look like this:
  #
  #     {
  #       "id": "DD2297B4-6982-4804-976A-AEA868564DF3",
  #       "type": "state_get",
  #       "resource": "projector",
  #       "var": "power"
  #     }
  #
  # This should produce the response:
  #
  #     {
  #       "id": "DD2297B4-6982-4804-976A-AEA868564DF3",
  #       "result": true
  #     }
  #
  # The allowed resource/var pairs are listed here:
  # #### projector
  #  - **state** (on/off/warming/cooling)
  #  - **video_mute** (true/false)
  #
  # #### volume
  #  - **level** (0-1.0)
  #  - **mute** (true/false)
  #
  # #### source
  #  - **
  # ###state_set
  # Sets the state of a variable
  #
  #     {
  #        "id": "D62F993B-E036-417C-948B-FEA389480984",
  #        "type": "state_set",
  #        "device": "Projector",
  #        "var": "power",
  #        "value": true
  #     }
  #
  # This will produce an ACK, which lets the client know that the request
  # was received.
  #
  #     {
  #        "id": "D62F993B-E036-417C-948B-FEA389480984",
  #        "ack": true
  #     }
  #
  # In order to know if this was successful, the client must wait for a
  # change in the variable (power, in this case) and ensure that it has
  # become the expected value.
  #
  # ###command
  # Executes a command
  #
  #     {
  #        "id": "D62F993B-E036-417C-948B-FEA389481512",
  #        "type": "command",
  #        "device": "IREmitter",
  #        "name": "send_command",
  #        "args": ["play"]
  #     }
  #
  # This will also produce an ACK, as above.
  #
  # ## Server -> Client
  # ### connected
  # When a client connects, the server sends it a bunch of useful information
  # for setting itself up. The message looks like this:
  #
  #     {
  #       "id": "AEF80ED8-35C6-4EBC-B80C-218C306CA393",
  #       "type": "connection",
  #       "building": {
  #          "guid": "cc7e9b6fe3e2757deba97d8d83157515",
  #          "name": "Albritton"
  #       },
  #       "room": {
  #          "guid": "99b9b6d7bc4c69844b9b70ff601e3124",
  #          "name": "004",
  #          "projector": "Projector",
  #          "switcher": "Extron",
  #          "volume": "Extron",
  #          "dvdplayer": "dvdplayer"
  #       },
  #       "devices": [
  #         {
  #            "guid": "0552c56cf2517e5d4b65d859541273fe",
  #            "name": "Extron",
  #            "state_vars": {
  #               "
  #            }
  #         }
  #       ]
